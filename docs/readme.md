# Drupal in Python Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This project aims to implement Drupal in Python using FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy. The goal is to provide a detailed and complete technical documentation for developers, both human and AI, to understand and implement the project.

## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drupal/drupal.git
   cd drupal
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   # Replace <DB_NAME>, <DB_USER>, and <DB_PASSWORD> with your database name, user, and password
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASSWORD>@localhost/<DB_NAME>"
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Pydantic:** Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **SQLAlchemy:** The Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.

## Documentation Files

The `docs` directory contains the following files:

- **readme.md:** Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up the development environment.
- **api.md:** Documents the API endpoints and their usage, including request and response examples, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and error handling and status codes.
- **functional-spec.md:** Describes the functional requirements of the project, including user stories, use cases, features, functionalities, and any constraints or limitations.
- **ui.md:** Documents the user interface design and layout, including wireframes or mockups, user interactions, workflows, and accessibility and usability considerations.
- **architecture.md:** Describes the overall architecture of the project, including a high-level diagram of the system components, data flow, interactions between components, and any design patterns or architectural principles used.
- **implementation.md:** Provides detailed instructions for implementing the project, including code snippets and examples for key components, database schema and migrations, and information on testing and debugging.
