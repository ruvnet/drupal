# Functional Specification

## Overview

This document describes the functional requirements of the project, including user stories, use cases, features, functionalities, and any constraints or limitations.

## User Stories and Use Cases

### User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to create an account so that I can access the system.**
2. **As a user, I want to log in to the system so that I can access my account and content.**
3. **As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete content so that I can manage my content.**
4. **As an admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions so that I can control access to the system.**

### Use Cases

1. **Create User Account**
   - **Actor**: User
   - **Precondition**: User is not logged in.
   - **Postcondition**: User account is created, and the user is logged in.
   - **Main Success Scenario**:
     1. User navigates to the registration page.
     2. User enters the required information (username, email, password).
     3. User submits the registration form.
     4. System creates the user account and logs the user in.
   - **Extensions**:
     - 3a. User enters invalid information:
       - 1. System displays an error message and prompts the user to correct the information.

2. **Log In**
   - **Actor**: User
   - **Precondition**: User has an existing account.
   - **Postcondition**: User is logged in.
   - **Main Success Scenario**:
     1. User navigates to the login page.
     2. User enters their username and password.
     3. User submits the login form.
     4. System authenticates the user and logs them in.
   - **Extensions**:
     - 3a. User enters incorrect username or password:
       - 1. System displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.

3. **Create Content**
   - **Actor**: User
   - **Precondition**: User is logged in.
   - **Postcondition**: Content is created and saved in the system.
   - **Main Success Scenario**:
     1. User navigates to the content creation page.
     2. User enters the required information (title, body).
     3. User submits the content creation form.
     4. System creates the content and saves it in the system.
   - **Extensions**:
     - 3a. User enters invalid information:
       - 1. System displays an error message and prompts the user to correct the information.

4. **Manage User Roles and Permissions**
   - **Actor**: Admin
   - **Precondition**: Admin is logged in.
   - **Postcondition**: User roles and permissions are updated.
   - **Main Success Scenario**:
     1. Admin navigates to the user management page.
     2. Admin selects a user to manage.
     3. Admin updates the user's roles and permissions.
     4. System updates the user's roles and permissions.
   - **Extensions**:
     - 3a. Admin enters invalid information:
       - 1. System displays an error message and prompts the admin to correct the information.

## Features and Functionalities

1. **User Management**
   - User registration
   - User login
   - User roles and permissions management

2. **Content Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete content
   - Content categorization and tagging

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Token-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

4. **API Endpoints**
   - User endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
   - Content endpoints (create, read, update, delete)

## Constraints and Limitations

1. **Scalability**
   - The system should be designed to handle a moderate number of users and content items. Scalability to a large number of users and content items may require additional optimizations and infrastructure.

2. **Security**
   - The system should implement standard security practices, including input validation, authentication, and authorization. However, it may not cover all possible security threats and vulnerabilities.

3. **Performance**
   - The system should provide reasonable performance for typical use cases. Performance optimization for high-load scenarios may require additional tuning and resources.

4. **Compatibility**
   - The system should be compatible with modern web browsers and devices. Compatibility with older browsers and devices may be limited.
