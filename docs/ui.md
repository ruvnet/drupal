# User Interface Design and Layout

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the user interface (UI) design and layout for implementing Drupal in Python using FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy. It includes wireframes or mockups, user interactions, workflows, and accessibility and usability considerations.

## Wireframes and Mockups

## User Interactions and Workflows

### 1. User Registration

1. User navigates to the registration page.
2. User enters the required information (username, email, password).
3. User submits the registration form.
4. System creates the user account and logs the user in.
5. User is redirected to the user dashboard.

### 2. User Login

1. User navigates to the login page.
2. User enters their username and password.
3. User submits the login form.
4. System authenticates the user and logs them in.
5. User is redirected to the user dashboard.

### 3. Content Creation

1. User navigates to the content creation page.
2. User enters the required information (title, body, tags).
3. User submits the content creation form.
4. System creates the content and saves it in the system.
5. User is redirected to the content management page.

## Accessibility and Usability Considerations

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensure that all content is accessible to screen readers by providing appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes and semantic HTML.
3. **Color Contrast**: Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast between text and background elements to improve readability for users with visual impairments.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the UI is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
5. **Form Validation**: Provide clear and concise error messages for form validation to help users correct any mistakes.
6. **Consistent Layout**: Maintain a consistent layout and design across all pages to provide a cohesive user experience.
